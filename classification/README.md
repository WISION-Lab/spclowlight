# Image Classification using simulated images for SPCs

This implements training of image classification models on CUB, miniplaces and imagenet dataset. Modified from pytorch examples
## Requirements

- Install PyTorch ([pytorch.org](http://pytorch.org))
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Download the dataset from official sources and use simulation script to generate low-light SPC images.

## Training

To train a model, use `bfile` script . Make sure to update the dataset location and desired parameters in the script before starting the training.

## Usage
```bash
./bfile
```
